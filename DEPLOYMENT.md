## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: AWS Amplify Console (Recommended)

1. **Visit AWS Amplify Console**

   ```
   https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/

2. **Connect Your Repository**
   - Click "New app" → "Host web app"
   - Connect your Git repository (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket)
   - Select the `main` branch

3. **Configure Build Settings**
   - Amplify will auto-detect the `amplify.yml` file
   - Verify the configuration:
     ```yaml
     Build image: Amazon Linux:2023
     Node.js version: 18 or higher
     Build command: npm run build
     Output directory: dist
     ```

4. **Environment Variables** (Optional)

   ```
   NODE_ENV: production
   VITE_APP_TITLE: LED Panel Designer
   ```

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Save and deploy"
   - Wait for build completion (~2-3 minutes)
   - Your app will be live at: `https://[app-id].amplifyapp.com`

### Option 2: Amplify CLI

```bash
# Install Amplify CLI globally
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli

# Configure AWS credentials (one-time setup)
amplify configure

# Initialize Amplify in your project
amplify init

# Add hosting
amplify add hosting
# Choose: Amazon CloudFront and S3

## 🔍 Monitoring & Analytics

AWS Amplify provides built-in monitoring:

- **Access logs**: View traffic patterns
- **Performance**: Monitor load times
- **Error tracking**: Catch runtime issues
- **Build logs**: Debug deployment issues

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

- Check Node.js version (18+ required)
- Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Review build logs in Amplify console

### Icons Not Loading

- Ensure SVG files are in `src/assets/icons/` folders
- Check that dynamic imports work in production

### Performance Issues

- Enable Amplify build caching
- Optimize large assets
- Use CloudFront CDN (enabled by default)

1. **Deploy your app** using Option 1 above
2. **Test thoroughly** on mobile and desktop
3. **Monitor performance** through Amplify console
4. **Set up custom domain** if needed
